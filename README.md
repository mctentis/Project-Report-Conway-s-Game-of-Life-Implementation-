# Project-Report-Conway-s-Game-of-Life-Implementation-
This project involved creating a simple implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The goal was to build a JavaScript function that applies the rules of the game to determine the next state of a cell based on its current state and the number of live neighbors.
